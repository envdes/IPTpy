# CEDSv2021_04_21
This Python script is used to process CEDSv2021_04_21 data using IPTpy. Users could use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to taste the code.  

```python
# import packages
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
from iptpy.anthro_emission.fv import FV
```

```python
# initialize
# download by globus
fv_instance = FV(
    preregrid_path='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/preregrid/', # path to the summed data
    regridder_filename='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/regridded/test_ceds_0.5x0.5_0.9x1.25_regridder.nc',
    regridded_path='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/regridded/',
    start_year=2000,
    end_year=2000,
    source='CEDS',
    version='v2021-04-21',
    original_resolution='0.5x0.5',
    download_method='globus'
)

# or download by wget
fv_instance = FV(
    preregrid_path='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/dataset/CEDS/CEDS_v2021_04_21/', # path to the wget downloaded data
    regridder_filename='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/regridded/test_ceds_0.5x0.5_0.9x1.25_regridder.nc',
    regridded_path='/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/regridded/',
    start_year=2000,
    end_year=2000,
    source='CEDS',
    version='v2021-04-21',
    original_resolution='0.5x0.5',
    download_method='wget'
)
```

## Step1: Sum up the emissions from sectors

`FV.sum_up` only works when `download_method` is `globus`. The summed data is saved in `preregrid_path`.

```python
fv_instance.sum_up('/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/dataset/PNNL_DataHub/CEDS_gridded_data_2021-04-21/data/')
```

 ## Step2: Regrid from 0.5째x0.5째 to 0.9째x1.25째"

```python
fv_instance.generate_regridder()
fv_instance.apply_regridder()
```

- Once a regridder exists, it can be reused and does not need to be generated when running `apply_regridder()` multiple times.

## Step3: Rename regridded data

```python
fv_instance.rename('/gws/nopw/j04/duicv/yuansun/IPTpy/tests/renamed/')
```

- Note that the `regridder_filename` and files in the `preregrid_path` or `regridded_path` or `renamed_path` will be automatically deleted before new files are generated, so manual deletion is not required.
